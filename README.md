My intent was to create a javascript file that would allow for a user to generate a random password following a few criteria prompts before clicking generate password. 

I was unable to determine how to get the password to generate but was able to get the code added in to allow the user to answer a few prompt questions. 

To DO: update functionality so that the password generator upon clicking the button will output a random password.
